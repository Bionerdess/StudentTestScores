# StudentTestScores
Multiple Linear Regression to predict student test scores

Dataset and Analysis outline
This dataset contains data from individual students (student ID). 

Their:

- school
- school type (public or non-public)
- school setting (urban, suburban, rural)
- classroom, teaching method (standard or experimental)
- number of students in the class
- gender of the student
- whether they qualify for a free/reduced lunch or not
- pre-test scores
- post-test scores

Here I will explore the data visually as well as conduct a multiple linear regression in order to identify possible features that could predict the post-test performance of students.
